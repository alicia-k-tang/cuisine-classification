# cuisine-classification
This repository contains my solution for the "What's Cooking?" Kaggle competition, where the goal is to predict the cuisine of a given recipe based on its ingredients. The solution leverages a combination of text classification models, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, with ensemble learning for improved accuracy. Explore the code, data preprocessing steps, and model implementations to understand the approach taken to tackle this culinary classification challenge.
